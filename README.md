# github-notifier

## What is this

This is a discord bot that emulates GitHub webhooks, why would you want that? Maybe you're not the repository owner but would still like to get mentioned on Discord when there is a new release.

## How to set up

`npm i`  
And place your discord token in token.json

## Invite
**Sidenote: I also use this bot for the test versions of this bot, so it might behave a little weird sometimes.**
